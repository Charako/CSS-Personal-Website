        <h3>Debating</h3>
        <img src="images/debate.png" alt="debating-img" class="picture-debate">
        <p>I have reached the final rounds of multiple debating competitions and have also been top speaker of the day on one occasion. I enjoy debating as it helps me think logically. I am always looking to improve my public speaking abilities as it
          is highly enjoyable because I enjoy seeing a well reasoned argument coming together to prove a point.</p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <img src="images/computer copy.png" alt="computer-img" class="picture-programming">
        <p>I have been programming since I was young with languages like Scratch, but my journey really begun when I started Python when I was 13. Since then, I have developed a number of complex projects, including Machine learning, Computational
          Physics and Discord Bots. Web Development has been my current project.</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <img src="images/piano.png" alt="piano-img" class="picture-piano">
        <p>Piano playing and music has always been a major part of my life. I started Piano when I was 8 and I am now working towards my DipABRSM. I listen to a wide range of music and it has always kept me calm during times of trouble. My favourite
          composers are Debussy and Liszt and I also enjoy listening to some modern pop and rock music as well.</p>
