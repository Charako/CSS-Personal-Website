# CSS-Personal-Website

This is the culmination of my efforts to learn CSS and HTML together as part of my larger project to learn Web Development. This website is, though pretty simplistic, the result of a lot of work, so hopefully you enjoy reading it!

Skills I have learnt pretty much encompass most of intermediate CSS, including advanced positioning methods, focusing on accuracy and cross-platform compatability, whilst also making use of more complicated design features, such as the use of image formating and various text colouring methods.
